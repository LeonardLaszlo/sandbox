\begin{experience}

{\LARGE Software Engineer at Move Digital, Zurich (Sep. 2019 - Ongoing)}

Currently I work on the development of a quoting system for financial products, where I use on a daily basis the following technologies:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Java 11, Spring Boot 2.2.x, Docker, Bash, Git, Github, Maven, Jenkins, Jira, Confluence, Intellij Idea
	\item MariaDB, PostgreSQL, ArangoDB, RabbitMQ, MinIO, Redis
  \item Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Beats, Websockets
\end{itemize}

My most significant contributions are in the implementation of financial products and trading workflows in Java.
Other personal accomplishments are: improving the coding guidelines, enabling most of the current Checkstyle and PMD rules, introduction of the ELK stack for monitoring and influencing the architectural and technological decisions.

{\LARGE Software Engineer at SimpledCard, Budapest (Oct. 2017 - Feb. 2019)}

At SimpledCard I worked in a small and highly efficient team with continuously improving processes.
I learned to accept and offer honest feedback and the importance of building tech culture in the team.
My role included the development of the payment system, fixing all the errors from the logs, feature design and specification, executing weekly releases and monitoring.
Other personal accomplishments include the migration from Java 7 to Java 8 and the automation of some manual back-office processes. The tech stack included:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Java 7 and 8, Spring Boot 1.5.x, AWS (SNS, SES, SQS S3, EC2, RDS, Cloud formation), PostgreSQL
	\item Vert.x (v2.x), Guice, Junit, Hamcrest, Bash, Maven, Git, Circle CI, Intellij Idea
\end{itemize}

{\LARGE Software Engineer at Evosoft, Budapest (Sep. 2016 - Oct. 2017)}

At Evosoft I worked on the Mindsphere project, which taught me many valuable lessons that influenced my career and helped me build many long lasting friendships.
I mostly worked on the development of the API gateway, and when needed I partly took over the leading of my team which resulted in a promotion to a senior position.
I frequently worked with:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Java 8, Spring Boot 1.5.x, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Redis, Node.js, Cloud Foundry, Gradle, Git, Gitlab CI
	\item Intellij Idea, TestNG, test-driven development, pair programming and custom agile processes.
\end{itemize}

{\LARGE Software Engineer at Siwena, Budapest (2014)}

Siwena is a monitoring system with notable clients, such as the Liszt Ferenc International Airport and the nuclear power plant at Paks.
It is used to process data from cameras, motion detectors, locks and sensors.
My contribution to the project was the design and implementation of a library for the communication with SNMP compatible devices.
We used the classic Java SE stack.

{\LARGE Testing Engineer at Testware, Budapest (2013)}

At Testware I tested Ada and C code running on Alstom's self-driving trains, metros and trams with IBM's RTRT.

{\LARGE About me}

I am a backend Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience with Java and its ecosystem.
When it suits the task better or when I have the freedom to try something new I also use other programming languages and tools.
For me the foundation of a good company culture means honest and clear communication, trust, constructive passionate debate, commitment, accountability and attention to results.
I like to pay attention to clean code, cover my work with tests, being involved in the planning process, architecture decisions, specifications and reviewing the code of my peers.
One of my most popular open-source projects is \href{https://github.com/LeonardLaszlo/nw.js-armv7-binaries}{\textit{NW.js for ARMv7}}.
